# Shared Layer

This layer contains shared utilities, constants, and types used across the application.

## Structure

### /constants

Application-wide constants and enums:

- User roles
- Configuration constants
- Error messages

### /types

Shared TypeScript types and interfaces:

- Pagination types
- Common response types
- Utility types

### /utils

Utility functions and helpers:

- Date formatters
- String utilities
- Common validators

## Best Practices

- Keep utilities pure and stateless
- Document shared components
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Keep this layer lightweight
