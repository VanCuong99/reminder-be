# Interfaces

This directory contains application interfaces.

## Purpose

Interfaces define the contracts between different layers of the application.
They follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, allowing high-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## Implementation

Currently, this directory is empty as interfaces are defined in their respective modules.
Future implementations may include:

- Repository interfaces
- Service interfaces
- Use case interfaces
- External service interfaces
