# Use Cases

This directory contains application use cases.

## Purpose

Use cases represent the business logic of the application.
They encapsulate the application-specific business rules and orchestrate the flow of data between entities and repositories.

## Implementation

Currently, this directory is empty as use cases are implemented directly in services.
Future implementations may include:

- User registration
- User authentication
- Password reset
- Event creation
- Event reminder
