# Cache Infrastructure

This directory contains cache implementations for the application.

## Purpose

The cache layer is responsible for:

- Storing frequently accessed data
- Reducing database load
- Improving application performance

## Implementation

Currently, this directory is empty as caching is not yet implemented.
Future implementations may include:

- Redis cache
- In-memory cache
- Distributed cache
